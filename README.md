# HubSpot CMS Slate

 A blank slate for theme development on HubSpot CMS.

 ### Info

The stack is somewhat opinionated and comes with a default set of build tools, preprocessors, etc:

- 📦 Webpack
- 💅 PostCSS w/ Tailwind & postcss-preset-env
- 🛠️ TypeScript

 ### Get Started

This project allows you to develop in 2 different environments:
- Remote - sync's changes to your HubSpot portal as you work
- Local - fetches your HubSpot pages and serves them with webpack-dev-server (allows fast-refresh)
